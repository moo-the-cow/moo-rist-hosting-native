## Quick Start

### Requirement
Check out the zip files for your Operating System

+ [Windows](windows/)

+ [Linux (x86_64)](linux/)

+ [Linux (arm64)](linux_arm64/)

+ [Mac](mac/)

#### For all Platforms:
Create a folder `rist-selfhosting` Copy both Zip files into that folder and extract both so it looks like
#### Windows
```
rist-selfhosting/
├── librist.zip
├── StatsServer.zip
├── banner.txt
├── stats.json
├── librist
|   ├── tools
|   │   ├── ristreceiver.exe
|   │   └── ristsender.exe
│   └── librist.a
└── StatsServer.exe
```

Download the bat file into your `rist-selfhosting` folder and double click the `RIST_Selfhosting.bat`

#### Linux, linux_arm64, macos
```
rist-selfhosting/
├── librist.zip
├── StatsServer.zip
├── banner.txt
├── stats.json
├── librist
|   ├── tools
|   │   ├── ristreceiver
|   │   └── ristsender
│   └── librist.a
└── StatsServer
```

Download the shell script into your `rist-selfhosting` folder and execute it

```
bash RIST_Selfhosting.sh
```

------------
so for both versions this will create a `credentials.txt` file that's getting autogenerated.

you can change the username or password any time, after it's generated the file will be used for authentication.

```
USERNAME=moo-msi9k7bifhjftdjr
PASSWORD=peqt78sdxei83x6kdh2c0zoquaq7i4
```
