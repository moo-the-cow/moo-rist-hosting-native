Check out the zip files for your Operating System

+ [Windows](windows/)

+ [Linux (x86_64)](linux/)

+ [Linux (arm64)](linux_arm64/)

+ [Mac (aarch64)](mac/)

#### For all Platforms:
Create a folder `rist-selfhosting` Copy both Zip files into that folder and extract both so it looks like
#### Windows
```
rist-selfhosting/
├── librist.zip
├── StatsServer.zip
├── banner.txt
├── stats.json
├── librist
|   └── tools
|       ├── ristreceiver.exe
|       └── ristsender.exe
└── StatsServer.exe
```

Download the bat file into your `rist-selfhosting` folder and double click the `RIST_Selfhosting.bat`

For the Remote Scenario use the `Rist_Selfhosting-remote.bat`

#### Linux, linux_arm64, macos
```
rist-selfhosting/
├── librist.zip
├── StatsServer.zip
├── banner.txt
├── stats.json
├── librist
|   └── tools
|       ├── ristreceiver
|       └── ristsender
└── StatsServer
```

Download the shell script `Rist_Selfhosting.sh` into your `rist-selfhosting` folder and execute it

```
bash RIST_Selfhosting.sh
```
For the Remote Scenario use the `Rist_Selfhosting-remote.sh`

------------
so for both versions this will create a `credentials.txt` file that's getting autogenerated.

you can change the username or password any time, after it's generated the file will be used for authentication.

```
USERNAME=moo-msi9k7bifhjftdjr
PASSWORD=peqt78sdxei83x6kdh2c0zoquaq7i4
```

## Description

**ON IRLBOX USE NO ENCRYPTION BUT USERNAME AND PASSWORD TO THE RECEIVER IN ANY SETUP**

**HOME-NETWORK:**
`[irlbox] (username,password,no-encryption,no secret) => [receiver] => [forwarder] (no-encryption, no-secret) => [OBS] (no-encryption, no-secret)`

**REMOTE-RELAY:**
`[irlbox] (username,password,no-encryption,no secret) => [receiver] => [forwarder] (encryption, secret) => [OBS] (encryption, secret)`

**Port Scenario:**
`irlbox => 2030 | relay | <= 5556 OBS`

## Troubleshooting
### The http port 8080 is already used, what am I gonna do?
just set an environment variable `env_http_port=8888` before the startup of the script or put it inside the script
### The websocket port 8081 is already used, what am I gonna do?
just set an environment variable `env_ws_port=8888` before the startup of the script or put it inside the script
